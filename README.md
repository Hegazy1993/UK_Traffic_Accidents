# UK_Traffic_Accidents
This project aims to develop an understanding of how the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents in the UK are related to driving and demographic conditions through the analysis of UK Government data sourced over a 5-year period (2017-2021).

The analysis seeks to examine how the occurrence of accidents varies spatially and temporally, and as a result of driving and demographic conditions. It also aims to understand how the odds of being in an accident of greater severity are associated with driving and demographic conditions.

To do so, we aim to initially visualise the spatial distribution of accident occurrences across the UK. We seek to do this in an interactive format that makes intuitive sense to a viewer. This will aid in the understanding of accident hotspots within the UK, while also providing locational context to the data. In tandem, we aim to understand the temporal patterns of accident occurrences in the dataset. This may involve identifying the rate of change of accidents across the 5-year period and will add temporal context to the data.

Having gained an understanding of the distribution and pattern of accident occurrences, we seek to visualise trends in accident occurrences against contextual driving and demographic factors. Next, we aim to identify how factors affect the odds of being in a crash of greater severity. To do so, we aim to first statistically assess how accident severity odds vary as a function of contextual driving conditions such as light, weather, road conditions, speed limit, and road class. Finally, we seek to statistically assess how accident severity odds vary as a result of contextual demographic factors, including driver age and sex.

**Specific Objective(s)**

The four key objectives of this project are as follows:

* Objective 1: Exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of accidents within the UK using the Folium library

* Objective 2: Using the Matplotlib package, visualise how accident occurrences vary with driving and demographic conditions

* Objective 3: Statistically assess, using the statsmodels package, how driving conditions affect the odds of being in an accident of greater severity

* Objective 4: Statistically assess, using the statsmodels package, how demographic conditions affect the odds of being in an accident of greater severity
